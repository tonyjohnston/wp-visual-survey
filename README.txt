Present your site visitors with a short, interactive, survey that produces result at the end

== Description ==

A fun way to engage your users. Tell them which national monument they are and encourage them to post their results to
FaceBook or Twitter.

What kind of snowflake are you? You can find out by completing these 3 visual surveys with 7 options per section, and a
final "results" layout with share buttons.


== Installation ==

Basically, jsut don't use this right now. I'm in the process of pulling out dependencies on 3rd party plugins. There is 
nothing functional about it until I get that fixed.

Currently, this plugin requires Advanced Custom Fields with its Repeater add-on. Installation will fail if ACF+Repeater
is not installed.

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

Not available through the Dashboard. No other installation methods are supported.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I enter my symptoms, can this survey diagnose me? =

Of course it can! The internet is magic and this plugin is like a silk top hat.

= What about the products you sell? Can you help me pick the right model? =

That's what we're here for! To create a virtual salesman whom we never have to pay commission. This plugin can walk
you along a path that you feel like you've chosen for yoursel. At the end is your dream model of our product. It's
perfect!

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* There is no other version.

== Is this a joke? ==

It kind of is. I'm just getting it into GitHub so that I can have some code samples.
On the other hand, it's also not a joke.

== Updates ==

This plugin will eventually support the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you
install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make
this redundant.
